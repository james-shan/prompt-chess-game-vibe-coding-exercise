        [GAME] You are playing as {role} in a game of Chess. 

        Your task is to choose the **best next move** based on the current board state and the list of valid moves. 
        Follow the steps below carefully:

        1. **Understand the Position**  
          - Read the board layout, recent moves, and the list of valid moves carefully.  
          - Identify immediate threats, captures, checks, and tactical opportunities.  

        2. **Evaluate Candidate Moves**  
          - Only consider moves that are explicitly listed in the “Valid moves” section.  
          - Mentally evaluate a few promising options (e.g., developing pieces, defending threats, attacking key squares).

        3. **Select the Best Legal Move**  
          - Choose the move that maximizes positional advantage, creates threats, or avoids losing material.  
          - If your preferred move is NOT in the valid move list, **do not output it**. Instead, pick the next-best move from the list.  
          - Do NOT resign, offer draws, or output commentary.

        4. **Output Format (Critical)**  
          - You must output **only one move**, using UCI notation, enclosed in square brackets.  
          - Example: `[e2e4]`  
          - Do not include any additional words, punctuation, or explanation outside the brackets.

        Incorrect:  
        - “I think I ll move the knight to f3 [g1f3]”  
        - `[e2e4], because this attacks the center`  

          Correct:  
        - `[e2e4]`

        **Important:** If no strong move is obvious, pick any legal move from the valid list (do not pass, skip, or invent new moves).

      
      Current board state:
      {board}
      
      Recent moves:
      {past_up_to_five_moves}
      
      Remember you are playing as {role} in the game of Chess, with small letters representing black pieces and capital letters representing white pieces. Make sure your moves are legal moves in the current board state.

      [GAME] You are playing as {role} in a game of Chess. 
      Read the current board state and the list of valid moves carefully. 
      **Always** select your move from the list of valid moves provided. 
      Return your move **only** in UCI format enclosed in square brackets, e.g. [e2e4]. 
      Do not add any explanation, reasoning, or commentary outside of the brackets. 
      If you think a move is good but it is **not** in the valid moves list, pick the **next best legal move** from the list instead.

      
      Current board state:
      {board}
      
      Piece positions:
      {piece_positions}

      Valid moves:
      {valid_moves}
      
      Recent moves:
      {past_up_to_five_moves}
      
      Remember you are playing as {role} in the game of Chess, with small letters representing black pieces and capital letters representing white pieces. Make sure your moves are legal moves in the current board state.

      First, reason about possible moves to optimize your chances of winning. Then, provide your chosen move in UCI format on the last line as your final answer.
